                Recollection day is a choice-based adventure set in Eastern Europe in a small farm town. 
                <br>You play a girl named Yulia, and she has a music box. It is filled with visions that you get from interaction with the environment.
                <br><br>Figure out clues, unlock secrets, and convince the people around you with what you find. Become the hero and save the town from the disasters which shall befall.
                A vision turns into a recollection once the prediction transpires. And that is when you know, it is, déjà vu

            <div class="content-text"> 
                In a family of five, you are the middle child. You have an older sister named Lily and a younger brother named Alistair.
                The memories of your childhood are full of laughter and warmth. You go outside with Lily and Alistair and play tag until night falls, arriving home in your parents' embrace.
                <br> You lived a childhood believing in love. Believing that your family love each other. Believing a lie.
                <br><br> Until the day your father left, never to be seen again. You have watched your mother cry, and your little brother cry because she does.
                <br> Lily, meanwhile, became sullen, distant. She did not cry as much as your mother or brother, there is only coldness in her eyes.
                <br> Your mother had fallen sick that she cannot work. She was taken to the city to be cured but all of you have to stay back in your country house by the woods.
                <br> Lily has to take care of the house and her brothers. She is just 13, and it has been two months since your mom is away.
                <br><br> But the fateful day came that you woke up to find yourself locked in your room. You tried to call your sister or your brother, but before you had the chance, you heard a cry.
                <br> It was Alistair's voice begging for his life. Begging that Lily won't kill him. But in vain, his cries grew forceful, desperate, intense. You shrieked, screamed, bellowed, struggled against the door that will not budge. You hear one bloodcurdling scream, and then another, the locked door hindering you to witness the murder that is happening. Then, the cries diminished, trailing away.
                <br><br> In one last desperate act, you slammed your head onto the door.
