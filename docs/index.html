                Yulia is a half-Ukrainian, half-Jew daughter of peasants, who grew in a rural town in Ukraine. The vast plains is suitable for farming, and for the past decade, her townspeople have worked with the Soviet Union.
                Occasionally, one of the Soviet trains will pass by and collect their harvest, grains and livestock, to feed the soldiers that they believe are protecting their quiet towns. 
                Come 1939 is the year when Germany's invasion of Eastern Europe. Trains started appearing more frequently. Quotes Vlad when Yulia comes to him, "They who stay behind should feed those in front. At the end, it is all fair."
                
                <br><br>The story starts one of the cows have escaped to the woods and Yulia's father went to search for it, in which he never came back. Iryna, Yulia's mom, tells her to sleep, assuring her that her father is coming back soon. 
                But Yulia, an ever curious soul, roamed around the town. She always brings her "music box", a strange one-of-a-kind contraption which she picked up in Kyiv, and she uses it to record and listen to interesting sounds.
                Yulia discovers a ravaged path which she believes is where the cow escaped. She follows that path and saw that it leads to a warehouse. Normally, she would enter anything but feeling an alarming gut instinct, she refuses and heads back to town.
                But while playing the train sound in her music box, she comes back into an entirely different town. Walls and roofs of the houses she used to go in are broken down. Rubble is everywhere. There is no house standing, no people she knew around, no animals, or living soul in sight. 
                In panic, she fled to the cave. But in that cave, she saw familiar people. Dmitry and Olga. They said they are sheltering in the cave because German soldiers will be bombing their town that night. 
                Yulia exits the cave and discovers that her town is back to normal. The houses and people are back where they used to be earlier in that day. Even Dmitry is back to talking about vipers in caves as though nothing bad happened.
                But when Yulia speaks to Olga, her message became darker, different. Mom said Olga loves swinging by other towns to gossip, and that Yulia shouldn't always believe her. But she tells her of rumors she had heard that the Germans are invading. One of the farm towns in the west have been completely destroyed, and she is afraid that they will come to their town next but even her husband, Dmitry, does not believe her.
                That is when Yulia realizes that the things she saw earlier while her music box is playing, are things that have not happened, but are about to happen.

                <br><br>"Silent spies" have infiltrated the Soviet warehouses as a first step for invasion, while capturing humans and animals without causing too much disruption. That way, people will not escape the town with their well-needed resources while they haven't taken enough ground to prevent this.
                Yulia survives the day her town got bombed by sheltering with Olga and Dmitry in a cave. The next day, Yulia sneaks the warehouse she found the first day and takes some food. The German guard is sleeping, complacent that nearby farmers are captured or gone. She finds Ivanovich, Olga and Dmitry's son, under the well. He is cold and hungry and Yulia gives him food. He comes up with Yulia in the town after learning that his parents are alive so that he can rejoin them.
                Yulia gets captured by a soldier the next day after being caught stealing food, and sends her to a hijacked train where they keep people from different towns prisoners.
                Because Yulia is light, the prisoners prop her on top of their shoulders so that Yulia can spy for them the geography outside looks like. She continues recording with her music box and talking to different prisoners, getting clues on where the trains come from and are going. The train stops and the prisoners are taken outside one-by-one. 
                When it was Yulia's turn, the soldier studies her and says there is a special train for her. But Yulia lies about her background, another prisoner was taken see if her witness is true and Yulia claims Dmitry is her dad. The prisoner, who knew Dmitry has a child but never met him, believed Yulia. She was not taken to the special train.
                The prisoners are taken to the nearest warehouse to eat. Yulia manages to loose her bonds and escape. For the next two days, she travels perilous roads and slopes, stop by warehouses and check abandoned houses for sustenance, until she finds her hometown. She finds Olga and Ivan in the cave. Dmitry notes that there are still some Soviet trains that are heavily guarded and not yet in German hands.
                Yulia and the family travelled by foot towards the train station. Dmitry approached the soldiers declared himself and his wife as one of the survivors of the rural town invasions, and they end up being enlisted for service. Ivan and Yulia stayed unbeknownst to soldiers, already jumped inside the train and hid in the sacks. The story ends with the train departing, bringing Yulia and Ivan to the place that is now called Russia.
                <br><br> Yulia's story in Recollection Day is a historical fiction, and events that occur in the game do not resemble a real account.
