# Recollection Day
## Overview
Recollection day is a choice-based adventure set in Eastern Europe in a small farm town.
You play a girl named Yulia, and she has a music box. It is filled with visions that you get from interaction with the environment.

Figure out clues, unlock secrets, and convince the people around you with what you find. Become the hero and save the town from the disasters which shall befall. A vision turns into a recollection once the prediction transpires. And that is when you know, it is, déjà vu
